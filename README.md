# OpenPCDet

`OpenPCDet` is a clear, simple, self-contained open source project for LiDAR-based 3D object detection. 

It is also the official code release of [`[PointRCNN]`](https://arxiv.org/abs/1812.04244), [`[Part-A2-Net]`](https://arxiv.org/abs/1907.03670), [`[PV-RCNN]`](https://arxiv.org/abs/1912.13192), [`[Voxel R-CNN]`](https://arxiv.org/abs/2012.15712), [`[PV-RCNN++]`](https://arxiv.org/abs/2102.00463) and [`[MPPNet]`](https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.05979). 

**Highlights**: 
* `OpenPCDet` has been updated to `v0.6.0` (Sep. 2022).
* The codes of PV-RCNN++ has been supported.
* The codes of MPPNet has been supported.

## Introduction


### What does `OpenPCDet` toolbox do?

Note that we have upgrated `PCDet` from `v0.1` to `v0.2` with pretty new structures to support various datasets and models.

`OpenPCDet` is a general PyTorch-based codebase for 3D object detection from point cloud. 
It currently supports multiple state-of-the-art 3D object detection methods with highly refactored codes for both one-stage and two-stage 3D detection frameworks.

Based on `OpenPCDet` toolbox, we win the Waymo Open Dataset challenge in [3D Detection](https://waymo.com/open/challenges/3d-detection/), 
[3D Tracking](https://waymo.com/open/challenges/3d-tracking/), [Domain Adaptation](https://waymo.com/open/challenges/domain-adaptation/) 
three tracks among all LiDAR-only methods, and the Waymo related models will be released to `OpenPCDet` soon.    

We are actively updating this repo currently, and more datasets and models will be supported soon. 
Contributions are also welcomed. 

### `OpenPCDet` design pattern

* Data-Model separation with unified point cloud coordinate for easily extending to custom datasets:
<p align="center">
  <img src="docs/dataset_vs_model.png" width="95%" height="320">
</p>

* Unified 3D box definition: (x, y, z, dx, dy, dz, heading).

* Flexible and clear model structure to easily support various 3D detection models:

* Support various models within one framework as:
